# Raspberry Pi Thermal Experiments
Raspberry Pi is built from components designed for personal electronics. This
means they're designed for quick bursts of high performance (pull out a phone
for a quick check) or long durations of lower performance (watching a movie).
Long durations of peak performance stress these components. Raspberry Pi will
protect itself from damage by throttling performance to stay within thermal
limits. In order to maintain high performance, additional cooling is required.

There are many Raspberry Pi thermal control ideas out there on the internet.
These are my experiments into the field.
